## What is object oriented programming?

Object - oriented programming is a programming paradigm/pattern/model where software is organized in a structure of classes and objects.
This paradigm also resemblance how we organize the real world around us. For example, imagine cars as a class and different car brands as objects of the car class.  

## What are the basic concepts of OOP?

Some of the basic concepts of object - oriented programming is classes, objects, methods, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism and data abstraction.

Class: A class is a datatype that contains data members or member variables and/or member functions. The member functions are methods used to operate on data members. We can also consider a class as the basic blueprint for instances/objects of that class.

Object: An object is an instance of a class created with specified values stored in the attributes field. By the attributes field, I'm referring to the data members of the class. Objects also have access to the classes methods to manipulate their specific values.      


## What are the main principles of OOP?

The four main principles of object - oriented programming is encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism. 

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation in object - oriented programming is the process of bundling or wrapping data with the methods or functions that operate on the said data into a single unit. This is often achieved trough the use of classes.  

Why would we use encapsulation?

- Security and data hiding: Encapsulation enables the developers to prevent users or classes from directly accessing certain data members or member functions. This is normally done by declaring all variables as private and providing "getter" - functions along with other methods to view or modify the values stored in the private members. There is some key benefits to why you would do this. Not only does it reduce the risk of human error, but it makes the code management simplier and the software easier to use, without revealing all the details behind the code.

- Aesthetics and scalability: By encapsulating your code you get a particuraly appealing, structured and organized look to the design, which makes your application more manageable and intuitive. By making it easier to add methods and variables, for example, it also opens up doors for scalability. Having the opportunity to scale and increase software performance is crucial when your met with new requirements.
