## What is UML?

- General purpose visual modeling language.


### Is it standard?

- Normally takes up to 300 work hours to complete a diagram.
- Hard to complete a UML diagram after the project has been initiated.
- The UML specification does not define a standard process but is intended to be useful with an iterative development process.
- UML is not a programming language but can be used to write programs. 
- UML is intended to be a universal general-purpose modelling language for GUI layout, VLSI circuit design, or rule-based artificial intelligence. 
- UML was developed in an effort to simplify and consolidate the large number of object-oriented development methods that had emerged. 

### Is it enforced?

- No, UML is not enforced.
- UML was developed in an effort to simplify and consolidate the large number of object-oriented developm 
- An effort to unify concepts among methods for books on object-oriented methodology appeared. 
- It was intended to supersede the models of OMT, Booch and Objectory. 

### Types of UML diagrams:

**Structural UML diagrams:

- Class diagram.
- Object diagram. 
- Package diagram. 
- Component diagram. 
- Composite structure diagram. 
- Deployment diagram. 
- Profile diagram. 

**Behavioural UML diagrams:

- Use diagram.
- Activity diagram. 
- Sequence diagram. 
- State diagram. 
- Communication diagram. 
- Interaction overview diagram. 
- Timing diagram. 

### FACT:

- The UML is a modeling language, not a description of a detailed development process. 

### Complexity of UML #1:

- UML is a product of persons with varied goals and interests. It shares the qualities of the product of a democratic process. 
- It is not as clean or coherent as the product of a single will. 
- It also contains superfluous features (but different persons might disagree about precisely what is superfluous). 

### Complexity of UML #2:

- There is tension between concepts for conceptual modeling and programming language representation, with no consisten guidelines. 
- You dont have to know or use every feature of UML any more than you need to know or use every feature of a large software application or programming language. 
- It is unnecessary to listen too much to UML language lawyers. There is no single right way to use it. 

### Contradictions! Everywhere!

- UML is more than a visual notation. UML models can be used to generate code and test cases. 

### What is OO Analysis and Design:

- Identify objects. 
- Define relationships.
- Establish interface. 
- Making design executable.
